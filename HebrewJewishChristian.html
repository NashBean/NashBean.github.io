        <h1> Islamic Jewish Christian</h1>
        <p>According to Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism(beleve in a single god) was the original religion of humanity.</p>
        <p>God of Gods has laid the foundation of his religion in his own image.</p>
        <p>Islam the Father's Religion, Judaism the Son's Religion, and Christianity the Holy Spirit's Religion.</p>
        <h2> Islam: Father Religion</h2>
        <p>The Quran says:
        The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah—the which We have sent by inspiration to thee—and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein:...
        — Quran, sura 42 (Ash-Shura), ayah 13[21]
        </p>
        <h2> Judaism: Son Religion</h2>
        <h2> Christian: Holy Spirit Religion</h2>
