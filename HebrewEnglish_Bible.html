        <h2> Genesis </h2>
        <h3> Chapter 1 </h>
        
        <p>1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
        2 Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters. 
        3 And God said: 'Let there be light.' And there was light. 
        4 And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. 
        5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. {P}
        </p>
        <a class=".box">
            In an unknown amout of time God created the heaven and the earth.  At this point the earth was a deep water planet drifting without a solor system.  And the earth came apon the yellow star we call our sun today. God then put the earth in rotation, rotating around the sun. Creating day and night on earth. 
        </a>

        <p>6 And God said: 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.' 
        7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. 
        8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. {P}
        </p>
            <a class=".box">
            God created the firmament to separate the "waters above" the earth from the "waters below" the earth. Scitist will soon figure out that when a rouge water planet comes into a solor system. It actavates the planet with internal friction from the 2 forces that hold it in a solor system. Separating the deapth of the water into 2 botties of water. One outside the crust and one inside the crust/magma. 
            </a>
            
        <p>9 And God said: 'Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.' And it was so.
           10 And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters called He Seas; and God saw that it was good. 
           11 And God said: 'Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth.' And it was so.
           12 And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind, and tree bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
           13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. {P}
